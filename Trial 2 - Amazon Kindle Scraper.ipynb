I loved to first two Riley Thorn books and I was crossing my fingers that this one would be just as good. My finger crossing was completely unnecessary because once again, Riley and Nick sucked me in to the great hilarity and insanity of of their life and I was immediately lost in the goodness of the story. It is another crazy comedic masterpiece that has suspense and mystery and love and sex. Our heroine, Riley Thorn, is a 34 year old divorced psychic good girl who is living and working with her boyfriend, Nick Santiago.  Our hero, Nick, is a 37 year old private eye who loves Riley and just wants to keep her safe. Nick and Riley are together again trying to solve mysteries, catch bad guys, deal with crazy family members, and try to get sexy private time in a house full of continual chaos and interruption. This time Nick has become obsessed with solving the cold case that haunts him while Riley is trying to keep their house from falling down around their ears and crossing her fingers that their romance is not fizzling out. The flow of the story is similar to the other books where Riley is in the middle of deep doodoo danger at the beginning of the book and the rest of the book explains how she once again ended up in that place.  Sprinkled throughout this beautifully paced story of Riley and Nickâ€™s most recent adventure, there are also a number of secondary characters included in RTatBftP.  Some are new but many weâ€™ve seen in past books. Rather than being overwhelming or detracting from the main love story and the mystery, these characters are central to the hilarity and the continued development of Riley and Nickâ€™s crazy dance of love and passion. I am keeping my fingers and toes crossed that there will be many more hilarious stories in this universe.\",\"reviewUrl\":\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1RE69VNDFSBJ4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09WRPWY7S\",\"total_found_helpful\":1,\"images\":[],\"variation\":{},\"videoUrl\":null},{\"stars\":5,\"date\":\"Reviewed in the United States on April 22, 2022\",\"verified_purchase\":true,\"manufacturer_replied\":false,\"username\":\"Ida Robinson\",\"userUrl\":\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEUMNSPWLQLRYQ7MVG5HNCRF3EYA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8\",\"title\":\"I Couldn't Wait for this Book, and it was Amazing!!!!!\",\"review\":\"This book deserves a million stars!!! I read the first 2 Riley Thorn books back to back and was chomping at the bit for this 3rd one to come out, and it was FANTASTIC!!!!!! This book was everything I was hoping for and so much more!It was amazing to be back with Riley, Nick and the gang in Harrisburg. And they have a new/old case that Nick is obsessing over. So much so, that he's turned down paying cases and is doing nothing but pour over old evidence. Of course it's the case about Beth, since Elenora said she wasn't dead. This causes all sorts of problems for Riley and brings up old insecurities from her ex husband. And Nick doesn't want Riley to use her powers to help find her. But that just makes Riley want to help even more.I don't want to give anything away because this book needs to be experienced without any spoilers, but Riley actually finds Beth or Beth finds Riley actually. And all the stress involved with Beth causes Riley to lose her powers, or get what Wander calls the Psychic Flu. My heart actually went out to Riley when all this went down. She was feeling like she was loosing Nick and she had no powers, so she felt useless.Of course, the whole gang was there for all the festivities!! And Mrs Penny is in rare form in this book and she's Nick's partner in his PI business. The cases she brings in are absolutely hilarious!! Lily and Fred are still hanging around Riley and Nick's house. We get to spend more time with Jasmine, Josie, and Kellan this time around. Jasmine is just amazing!!! The Thorn family is present in force this book, all trying to help Riley with her power problem. And then there's Gabe, in all his huge, manly stature! He and Nick have a wonderful scene at his birthday party that is forever stuck in my brain!!! Hell, that whole birthday party is stuck in my brain, in a good way!!!! So freaking funny!!!And the best part of this book is that it's not the last one!!!! It ended on a cliff hanger, like the previous 2, which means that we get more Riley Thorn!!!!!!

With our own world gone off the rails, this crafty storyteller gives us a fictional world in utter, side-splitting, hilarious chaos, providing the perfect escape from real life and, perhaps, casting our own world in a new light.Riley and her hunky PI boyfriend, Nick, may have their own place, but if they wanted any privacy, they shouldnâ€™t have chosen the house next door to their geriatric posse. Yeah, this is the dead guy's house from the previous RT adventure â€“ picture the house from the movie, Money Pit, but worse. Riley is up to her eyeballs in To Do lists while Nick isnâ€™t much help with his head stuck up his, er, in a cold case from six years ago.That blast from the past breezes right into Riley and Nick's guest room, bringing some unsavory elements with it. And when Riley pushes too much trying to get a read on their guest, her psychic WiFi goes on the fritz, leaving her to deal with things through good, old fashioned ingenuity. With a Halloween party where mayhem rules supreme and gets a rise out of everyone, the danger comes to a head and help arrives from the least likely of places.Clear your calendar and make your excuses to your family, because once you start this one, you wonâ€™t want to put it down. These endearing characters will make you laugh until tears are running down your face. And if you pay attention to the nuances, you'll find some gems to bring back with you into the real world that will serve you well. Charming, outrageous, and magnificent, you'll fall nose over toes for Riley and her marvelous band of misfits, so start reading this one today!\",\"reviewUrl\":\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RPAHXQGFVBOXU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09WRPWY7S\",\"total_found_helpful\":8,\"images\":[],\"variation\":{},\"videoUrl\":null}],\"pagination\":[\"https://www.amazon.com/Riley-Thorn-Blast-Past-Score-ebook/product-reviews/B09WRPWY7S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2\"]}\n"

       "   'title': 'Another hilarious romantic adventure for Riley and Nick',\n",
       "   'review': 'Oh my goodness. I loved to first two Riley Thorn books and I was crossing my fingers that this one would be just as good. My finger crossing was completely unnecessary because once again, Riley and Nick sucked me in to the great hilarity and insanity of of their life and I was immediately lost in the goodness of the story. It is another crazy comedic masterpiece that has suspense and mystery and love and sex. Our heroine, Riley Thorn, is a 34 year old divorced psychic good girl who is living and working with her boyfriend, Nick Santiago.  Our hero, Nick, is a 37 year old private eye who loves Riley and just wants to keep her safe. Nick and Riley are together again trying to solve mysteries, catch bad guys, deal with crazy family members, and try to get sexy private time in a house full of continual chaos and interruption. This time Nick has become obsessed with solving the cold case that haunts him while Riley is trying to keep their house from falling down around their ears and crossing her fingers that their romance is not fizzling out. The flow of the story is similar to the other books where Riley is in the middle of deep doodoo danger at the beginning of the book and the rest of the book explains how she once again ended up in that place.  Sprinkled throughout this beautifully paced story of Riley and Nickâ€™s most recent adventure, there are also a number of secondary characters included in RTatBftP.  Some are new but many weâ€™ve seen in past books. Rather than being overwhelming or detracting from the main love story and the mystery, these characters are central to the hilarity and the continued development of Riley and Nickâ€™s crazy dance of love and passion. I am keeping my fingers and toes crossed that there will be many more hilarious stories in this universe.',\n",

       "   'review': \"This book deserves a million stars!!! I read the first 2 Riley Thorn books back to back and was chomping at the bit for this 3rd one to come out, and it was FANTASTIC!!!!!! This book was everything I was hoping for and so much more!It was amazing to be back with Riley, Nick and the gang in Harrisburg. And they have a new/old case that Nick is obsessing over. So much so, that he's turned down paying cases and is doing nothing but pour over old evidence. Of course it's the case about Beth, since Elenora said she wasn't dead. This causes all sorts of problems for Riley and brings up old insecurities from her ex husband. And Nick doesn't want Riley to use her powers to help find her. But that just makes Riley want to help even more.I don't want to give anything away because this book needs to be experienced without any spoilers, but Riley actually finds Beth or Beth finds Riley actually. And all the stress involved with Beth causes Riley to lose her powers, or get what Wander calls the Psychic Flu. My heart actually went out to Riley when all this went down. She was feeling like she was loosing Nick and she had no powers, so she felt useless.Of course, the whole gang was there for all the festivities!! And Mrs Penny is in rare form in this book and she's Nick's partner in his PI business. The cases she brings in are absolutely hilarious!! Lily and Fred are still hanging around Riley and Nick's house. We get to spend more time with Jasmine, Josie, and Kellan this time around. Jasmine is just amazing!!! The Thorn family is present in force this book, all trying to help Riley with her power problem. And then there's Gabe, in all his huge, manly stature! He and Nick have a wonderful scene at his birthday party that is forever stuck in my brain!!! Hell, that whole birthday party is stuck in my brain, in a good way!!!! So freaking funny!!!And the best part of this book is that it's not the last one!!!! It ended on a cliff hanger, like the previous 2, which means that we get more Riley Thorn!!!!!! YEAH!!!\",\n",

       " \"Our favorite psychic and all-around trouble magnet is back along with her ridiculous, charming cast of friends and just as much madcap hilarity as before. With our own world gone off the rails, this crafty storyteller gives us a fictional world in utter, side-splitting, hilarious chaos, providing the perfect escape from real life and, perhaps, casting our own world in a new light.Riley and her hunky PI boyfriend, Nick, may have their own place, but if they wanted any privacy, they shouldnâ€™t have chosen the house next door to their geriatric posse. Yeah, this is the dead guy's house from the previous RT adventure â€“ picture the house from the movie, Money Pit, but worse. Riley is up to her eyeballs in To Do lists while Nick isnâ€™t much help with his head stuck up his, er, in a cold case from six years ago.That blast from the past breezes right into Riley and Nick's guest room, bringing some unsavory elements with it. And when Riley pushes too much trying to get a read on their guest, her psychic WiFi goes on the fritz, leaving her to deal with things through good, old fashioned ingenuity. With a Halloween party where mayhem rules supreme and gets a rise out of everyone, the danger comes to a head and help arrives from the least likely of places.Clear your calendar and make your excuses to your family, because once you start this one, you wonâ€™t want to put it down. These endearing characters will make you laugh until tears are running down your face. And if you pay attention to the nuances, you'll find some gems to bring back with you into the real world that will serve you well. Charming, outrageous, and magnificent, you'll fall nose over toes for Riley and her marvelous band of misfits, so start reading this one today!\",\n",
       " \"This book deserves a million stars!!! I read the first 2 Riley Thorn books back to back and was chomping at the bit for this 3rd one to come out, and it was FANTASTIC!!!!!! This book was everything I was hoping for and so much more!It was amazing to be back with Riley, Nick and the gang in Harrisburg. And they have a new/old case that Nick is obsessing over. So much so, that he's turned down paying cases and is doing nothing but pour over old evidence. Of course it's the case about Beth, since Elenora said she wasn't dead. This causes all sorts of problems for Riley and brings up old insecurities from her ex husband. And Nick doesn't want Riley to use her powers to help find her. But that just makes Riley want to help even more.I don't want to give anything away because this book needs to be experienced without any spoilers, but Riley actually finds Beth or Beth finds Riley actually. And all the stress involved with Beth causes Riley to lose her powers, or get what Wander calls the Psychic Flu. My heart actually went out to Riley when all this went down. She was feeling like she was loosing Nick and she had no powers, so she felt useless.Of course, the whole gang was there for all the festivities!! And Mrs Penny is in rare form in this book and she's Nick's partner in his PI business. The cases she brings in are absolutely hilarious!! Lily and Fred are still hanging around Riley and Nick's house. We get to spend more time with Jasmine, Josie, and Kellan this time around. Jasmine is just amazing!!! The Thorn family is present in force this book, all trying to help Riley with her power problem. And then there's Gabe, in all his huge, manly stature! He and Nick have a wonderful scene at his birthday party that is forever stuck in my brain!!! Hell, that whole birthday party is stuck in my brain, in a good way!!!! So freaking funny!!!And the best part of this book is that it's not the last one!!!! It ended on a cliff hanger, like the previous 2, which means that we get more Riley Thorn!!!!!! YEAH!!!\",\n",
       " 'I was so disappointed. I didnâ€™t laugh one time. Not once. I was so excited for this book to come out. I loved the first two. This was a let down. I found the whole thing to be annoying, frustrating, and boring. What happened to the funny?',\n",
       " 'Oh my goodness. I loved to first two Riley Thorn books and I was crossing my fingers that this one would be just as good. My finger crossing was completely unnecessary because once again, Riley and Nick sucked me in to the great hilarity and insanity of of their life and I was immediately lost in the goodness of the story. It is another crazy comedic masterpiece that has suspense and mystery and love and sex. Our heroine, Riley Thorn, is a 34 year old divorced psychic good girl who is living and working with her boyfriend, Nick Santiago.  Our hero, Nick, is a 37 year old private eye who loves Riley and just wants to keep her safe. Nick and Riley are together again trying to solve mysteries, catch bad guys, deal with crazy family members, and try to get sexy private time in a house full of continual chaos and interruption. This time Nick has become obsessed with solving the cold case that haunts him while Riley is trying to keep their house from falling down around their ears and crossing her fingers that their romance is not fizzling out. The flow of the story is similar to the other books where Riley is in the middle of deep doodoo danger at the beginning of the book and the rest of the book explains how she once again ended up in that place.  Sprinkled throughout this beautifully paced story of Riley and Nickâ€™s most recent adventure, there are also a number of secondary characters included in RTatBftP.  Some are new but many weâ€™ve seen in past books. Rather than being overwhelming or detracting from the main love story and the mystery, these characters are central to the hilarity and the continued development of Riley and Nickâ€™s crazy dance of love and passion. I am keeping my fingers and toes crossed that there will be many more hilarious stories in this universe.']"
